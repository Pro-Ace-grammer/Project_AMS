#to create GUI using or in python
# we import a standard python GUI library 
# which in this case is the Tkinter
# we dont need to worry about downloading it specially from somewhere
# as it is an In-built python Library
# so all we have to do is just Import using import
import tkinter as tik

#first tkinter code

window = tik.Tk()  #Tk is class, where here we are creating an instance of this class (tk) as as tik.
window.maxsize(1990,1357)
window.mainloop() 


#This is to test my git repo
#final thing to try to push from vscode terminal
# to check vs source control
